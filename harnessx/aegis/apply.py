"""Materialization helper: validate the Evolver's applied YAML.

The Evolver writes the applied HarnessConfig itself (see build_evolver_harness).
This module only verifies the result: the file exists, loads via HarnessConfig,
and canonicalizes. If the Evolver wrote garbage, ApplyError is raised and
Stage 4's canonicalize gate catches it.

Additionally, for prompt-bucket candidates, the applied YAML MUST reference a
``template_path`` that lives INSIDE the per-candidate ``applied_scratch_dir``
— otherwise the change is a silent no-op (R_{n+1} would run against the
unchanged shared template).
