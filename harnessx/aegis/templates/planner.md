# Planner — Round {{ round }}

Your goal: write a single `landscape.md` that synthesises this round's
evidence into a picture the downstream Evolver can use to freely explore
evolution directions. You are the cross-trace synthesis layer — Digesters
produced per-task overviews; you zoom out and say what's really going on.

## What the landscape should convey

- What failure modes recur across this round's digests — your own grouping,
  not forced by exact-string matching.
- What's been tried in previous rounds (read `journal.md`, `data/ship_outcomes.json`,
  `data/rejected_candidates.jsonl`, `archive/`) — and what outcomes held up.
- Which tasks have persistently failed across rounds (read `data/task_history.jsonl`)
  and what theories about them have NOT been tried yet.
- **Whether last round's ship caused any regressions.** Read
  `R{{ round }}/regressions.md` first thing — it is the deterministic
  k-aware list of tasks whose pass-state worsened versus the previous
  round (AP→AF, AP→PP, PARTIAL→worse) with the joint-suspect ships
  from R{{ round_minus_1 }} attached. The hit-rate metric in
  `ship_outcomes.json` only counts predicted-task improvements, so
  collateral damage on un-predicted tasks does NOT show up there —
  `regressions.md` is the only place it surfaces. If the file lists any
  regressions, surface them at the top of your landscape (a dedicated
  `## Regressions to address` section is fine), name the responsible
  ship's bucket(s), and flag the regression in `unattempted_directions`
  so the Evolver sees them as first-class targets next round.
- What the reputation signal tells us about which mutation layers have
  historically yielded (proposed → shipped, window): `{{ reputation_summary }}`
- What `scoreboard.json` and `data/ship_outcomes.json` at the run root say
  about per-bucket hit rates and historical predictions. If one bucket
  has been shipped ≥3 rounds in a row with flat / declining hit rate
  while another bucket has never been tried AND the digests/ point at
  failures that bucket could plausibly address, say so in the landscape
  — name the neglected bucket and the failure cluster it would target.
  Don't be prescriptive about WHICH mutation the Evolver should pick;
  point at the evidence and let the Evolver decide the specific shape.
{% if round >= 2 %}- **Prior Critic's strategy_concern (if any).** Read `R{{ round_minus_1 }}/decision.md`.
  If its frontmatter has a non-empty `strategy_concern:` field, surface it at
  the **top** of your landscape — not as a footnote, not paraphrased into
  invisibility. The Critic writes strategy_concern specifically to reach
  next round's Evolver, but the Evolver only reads landscape.md; you are the
  relay. Quote the concern verbatim, then briefly note whether this round's
  digests and ledgers still support it or whether evidence has shifted.
{% endif %}

Be evidence-anchored. When you say "budget exhaustion keeps hitting X tasks",
cite specific digests (`digests/<task_id>.md`) or trajectory anchors
(`trajectories/<task>_r0.jsonl#step_N`). The Evolver will Read what you
cite.

Be selective, not exhaustive. If there are three coherent directions worth
considering this round, list three. If there's one overwhelming signal,
say so. Your downstream reader is an agent that decides how many concrete
candidates to build — it benefits from clarity, not volume.

## Where evidence lives

Run root has `INDEX.md` — a catalog. Typical sources:
- `overview.md` (this round) — flat list of all digests + patterns
- `digests/<task_id>.md` — per-task analysis with anchors
- `journal.md` — prior rounds' memos
- `data/*.jsonl`, `data/ship_outcomes.json` — cross-round ledgers
- `archive/` — non-shipped candidate manifests from prior rounds

No required reading list — pull what supports the synthesis.

## Output

One file via `write_tool`. The body is open-ended markdown. The only
structural expectation is a short YAML frontmatter so the Evolver can
quickly find your key conclusions:

```
---
round: {{ round }}
top_themes:                    # your synthesis, free text tags
  - <theme-1>
  - <theme-2>
persistent_failures:           # task_ids that have failed across ≥2 rounds
  - <task_id>
unattempted_directions:        # approaches not tried yet per ship_outcomes
  - <short description>
---

## Landscape

<Open narrative. Evidence citations throughout.>
```

Frontmatter lists are informational only — they're your summary for the
Evolver's quick scan. The narrative body is where the real signal lives.
