"""Compose multiple shipped candidates' applied configs onto a base.

Each candidate's applied YAML is a FULL HarnessConfig derived from the
round's base config + the candidate's bucket-specific change. When
multiple candidates ship in the same round, we can't just take "last
wins" — each candidate's unchanged fields would silently overwrite
earlier candidates' changes.

This helper diffs each candidate's bucket-relevant fields against the
frozen parent and applies only those changes to the running base:

  prompt     — take candidate's `template_path` for the SystemPromptProcessor
  tools      — merge candidate's `tool_registry.custom` vs parent: drop
               entries parent had but candidate removed, append entries
               candidate added
  config     — replace matching processor kwargs (matched by `_target_`)
  processor  — apply candidate's processor diff vs parent: drop processors
               parent had but candidate removed, append processors candidate
               added (matched by `_target_`)

Multi-ship is only valid when each shipped candidate's bucket is
DISJOINT from the others. Stage 4 enforces that constraint before
calling this function.
